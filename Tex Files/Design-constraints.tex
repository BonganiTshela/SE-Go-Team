\subsection{Data Module}
Some design constraints for the data module include:
  \begin{itemize}

      \item The correct data types for information to be entered into the system database need to be carefully chosen. 
    Data types need to fit accordingly as to not watse overall system storage and downgrade the systems performance.

      \item The system server need to be equipped with a quality processor in order to process mass amounts of upstream and downstram data at the same time.
    Failure to implement a quality processor, might lead to the system crashing under the pressure of mass amounts of requests from users.

    \item The server hardware need be equipped with the correct and necessary security measures.
    Failure to equip the server with the correct and necessary security measures might lead to the system database being at risk,
    which can lead to sensitive user information being at risk for theft or even loss.

  \end{itemize}
