\section{Technology Choices}

\subsection{Navigation Module}
Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library that provides mapping functions for mobile developers. It runs efficiently on all major mobile and desktop platforms and therefore satisfies our requirement of the NavUP system needing to have Android, iOS and a web-based frontend. Leaflet can work with custom GIS data so will allow for the use of our provided GIS mapping of the University of Pretoriaâ€™s campus. The API at a basic level is mainly for displaying map data however there are a number of plugins available to expand the functionality. One of these is called Leaflet Routing Machine and provides a graphical extension to leaflet, displaying routes between a start and end point. Leaflet routing machine provides additional functionality for backend routing engines, one of these being OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine). OSRM uses extremely fast methods for shortest path routing and provides turn by turn navigation instructions to the user. These three technologies already interface with one another, are all open source and satisfy most of the constraints of the NavUP Navigation module. Additional implementation could ensure that the technologies integrate well into the NavUP system.
